# Goldstonian Concordance Bible — SUBDAOS (Source of Truth)

**Repo purpose:** This repository is the **canonical registry + governance hub** for every **SUBDAO** that exists under the **Goldstonian Concordance Bible (GCB) framework**.

If it’s a SUBDAO and it’s part of the GCB ecosystem, it must be represented here.

## What is a SUBDAO in the GCB framework?

A **SUBDAO** is a scoped, mission-locked governance unit that:
- has a defined spiritual + operational purpose
- ships assets (books, curricula, software, datasets, events, labs, charities, etc.)
- produces public “receipts” (evidence trails, logs, reports, releases)
- follows the **Goldstonian Doctrine** (Mirror → Water → Fire) as the tiebreaker authority

**This repo is the source of truth** for:
- SUBDAO names, slugs, status, scope, and owners
- charters, policies, and governance rules
- manifests and metadata for AI/agent retrieval
- links to code, content, legal docs, and public receipts

## First Divine DAO

### ✅ GBC Method SUBDAO (The Greensboro Batting Center Method)
The **Greensboro Batting Center Method** is recognized here as the **first Divine DAO** in the GCB framework.

**Why it matters**
- A living method → a repeatable discipline → a teachable system
- Evidence-driven, legacy-driven, human-building
- Fits Mirror → Water → Fire as an operational doctrine:
  - **Mirror:** self-assessment, honest reps, correction
  - **Water:** consistency, rhythm, training cycles, community
  - **Fire:** transformation, leadership, outcomes, legacy

This SUBDAO will be used as the reference template for all future SUBDAOs.

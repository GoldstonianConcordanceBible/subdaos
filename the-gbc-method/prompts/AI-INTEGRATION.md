Design a safe AI-enabled training feedback loop for a baseball facility.

Constraints:
- No medical diagnosis
- Respect privacy (minors); store minimal personal data
- Use simple tools: video timestamps, tagged notes, basic metrics

Output:
- Data you capture (minimal)
- Workflow (capture -> tag -> review -> plan -> repeat)
- 5 metrics that matter (age-appropriate)
- Parent-facing weekly report template
- “Human first” rule: coach makes final decisions, AI supports
